    "**Considerations**\n",
    "1. A gender balanced team will have equal number of male and female students\n",
    "    - In a team of 5, a gender balanced team will be either 2 males to 3 females or 3 males to 2 females [2:3 or 3:2]\n",
    "    - We do our best not to have a team dominated by 1 gender\n",
    "        * 4 females to 1 male or 1 female to 4 males [4:1 or 1:4]\n",
    "        * 5 males to 0 female or 0 male to 5 females [5:0 or 0:5]\n",
    "        * The only exception would be there's insufficient female or male students to form a gender balanced team\n",
    "2. We will not move students from the team that do not fulfill teamSize to other teams\n",
    "    - In a tutorial group of 50 students, with a teamSize of 7, we will have 7 teams of 7 students each (49 students in total)\n",
    "    - The remaining 1 student will form a separate team (1 team of 1 student)\n",
    "    - Reason: The decision to move the student into other team will be up to the teacher's discretion\n",
    "        * The teacher knows the course content and the difficulties of the assignment/project\n",
    "        * The teacher is more suited to make the decision to move the student into other team or change the teamSize accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preparation**\n",
    "1. Retrieve a list of students based on tutorialGroupNum\n",
    "2. Separate the list of students into two lists (list of male students and list of female students)\n",
    "3. Calculate the number of teams that can be filled fully up to teamSize\n",
    "4. Create a list of teams based on step 3\n",
    "5. Calculate the number of male and female students that can be added equally into a team\n",
    "    * In a team of 5, the number is 2\n",
    "    * 2 girls and 2 boys can be added equally into a team (1:1 ratio)\n",
    "    * Reason: We want a team of balanced genders. By adding in a 1:1 ratio, we ensure equal division of male/female students into teams\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Sorting**\n",
    "1. Check if there's student to be added. If none, return empty team list\n",
    "2. Start adding male and female students in 1:1 ratio into created teams based on step 4 of Preparation.\n",
    "3. There will be 3 outcomes during the sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Outcome 1*\n",

    "    *Outcome 2*\n",
    "    - There is not enough female students to continue the sort\n",
    "    - Fill up all teams with male students fully up to teamSize\n",
    "    - Run createTeamForRemainingStudent() to ensure all students has a team\n",
